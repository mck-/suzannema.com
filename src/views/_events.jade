      p In this appearance, Suzanne will draw parallels between the Chinese experience in Italy and the Chinese-American experience and talk about the challenges she faced reporting and researching her book in China and in Europe. She will tackle some hard questions: Is life better in the West? And why do so many Chinese immigrants (the largest diaspora in the world) continue to seek better lives outside of China?

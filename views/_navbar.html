A graduate of Columbia University’s Graduate School of Journalism, Suzanne was awarded the Pulitzer Traveling Fellowship, which helped fund her fieldwork in China for her first book, Meet Me in Venice.</p><p>Born in Toronto, Suzanne was raised by immigrant parents who insisted she attend Chinese school every Saturday morning. Her Chinese lessons continued in Beijing when she met her husband while studying abroad. His family’s hometown is also Ye Pei’s, and the town’s remarkable 300-year history of emigration inspired this book.</p><p>Suzanne and her husband live in Vancouver, Canada.</p></div><div class="small-12 large-4 large-pull-8 columns text-center"><img src=./images/suzanne.png class="suzanne"><h2>Get in touch!</h2><div class=red-line></div><div class=social><a href=http://ca.linkedin.com/in/suzannebma target=_blank><img src="./images/linkedin.png"></a><a href=https://twitter.com/suzannebma target=_blank><img src="./images/twitter.png"></a><a href=https://www.facebook.com/public/Suzanne-Ma target=_blank><img src="./images/facebook.png"></a><a href=https://plus.google.com/+SuzanneMa target=_blank><img src="./images/google.png"></a></div></div></div></div><a name=book></a><div data-magellan-destination=book class="row section-padding"><div class="small-12 large-5 large-offset-1 columns small-only-text-center"><h1 class=title>Meet Me in Venice</h1><h2>A Chinese Immigrant’s Journey from the Far East to the Faraway West</h2><br><p>When Ye Pei dreamed of Venice as a girl, she imagined a magical floating city of canals and gondola rides. And she imagined her mother, successful in her new life and eager to embrace the daughter she had never forgotten. But when Ye Pei arrives in Italy, she learns her mother works on a farm far from the city. Her only connection, a mean-spirited Chinese auntie, puts Ye Pei to work in a small-town café. Rather than giving up and returning to China, a determined Ye Pei takes on a grueling schedule, resolving to save enough money to provide her family with a better future.</p><p>A groundbreaking work of journalism, Meet Me in Venice provides a personal, intimate account of Chinese individuals in the very act of migration. Suzanne Ma spent years in China and Europe to understand why Chinese people choose to immigrate to nations where they endure hardship, suspicion, manual labor and separation from their loved ones. Today all eyes are on China and its explosive economic growth. With the rise of the Chinese middle class, Chinese communities around the world are growing in size and prosperity, a development many westerners find unsettling, and even threatening. Following Ye Pei’s undaunted path, this inspiring book is an engrossing read for those eager to understand contemporary China and the enormous impact of Chinese emigrants around the world.</p></div><div class="small-12 large-4 large-offset-1 columns text-center"><div class=book-2><img src="./images/book02.png"></div><div class=quote-box><p class=quoted>An eye opening tale about picking up and leaving home in search of a better life</p></div><p>- Jan Won, award-winning author of Red China Blues & Beijing Confidential</p><div class=pre-order><h2>Pre-order today</h2><a href="http://amazon.com/Meet-Me-Venice-Chinese-Immigrants/dp/1442239360/"><img src="./images/amazon.png"></a><a href="http://barnesandnoble.com/w/meet-me-in-venice-suzanne-ma/1119943108?ean=9781442239364"><img src="./images/barnes.png"></a><a href=http://chapters.indigo.ca/books/meet-me-in-venice/9781442239364-item.html><img src="./images/chapters.png"></a><a href=http://www.indiebound.org/book/9781442239364><img src="./images/indiebound.png"></a></div></div></div><div class=red-bar><a name=contact></a><div data-magellan-destination=contact class="row section-padding-small"><div class="small-10 small-centered columns text-center"><h1 class=white>Newsletter Sign Up</h1><form action="//suzannema.us9.list-manage.com/subscribe/post?u=78b517653bd9e7517b714e4bf&amp;amp;id=9253a4c48e" method=post id=mc-embedded-subscribe-form name=mc-embedded-subscribe-form target=_blank novalidate><input type=email name=EMAIL placeholder="Email address" required class="email"> <div style="position: absolute; left: -5000px"><input name=b_78b517653bd9e7517b714e4bf_9253a4c48e tabindex=-1></div><input type=submit value=Subscribe name=subscribe class="button round"></form><h1 class="section-padding-top white">Contact</h1><p>Please direct all <span>rights inquiries</span> to my agent:<br>Elizabeth Evans, Jean V.
